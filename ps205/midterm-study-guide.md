The exam will be administered in class on November 3rd during our normally scheduled class
hours. The exam may consist of true/false, multiple choice, fill in the blank, identification, short
answer, and essay questions.

## Reference Materials

This exam will cover the chapters that we have covered thus far in the Frieden, Lake, and Schultz
text, the readings on Canvas (see Reading Schedule at the end of the course syllabus), and our
course lectures, simulations, and videos.

## Grading

This exam is worth (200) points, or twenty (20) percent of the total course grade.

## Makeup Exams

Late exams will not be accepted unless students are able to provide a reason and documentation in line with the course
Makeup Policy outlined in the syllabus. In all other cases a failure to take the exam results in a score of zero.

# Terms/Concepts of Interest

As always, everything from our readings and lectures is fair game. This study guide is not meant to be exhaustive, but
rather a tool to help students focus on key issues in the texts and lectures that merit attention.

## Realism

Realism is one of our core paradigms that is used to explain how interstate politics works. To be prepared for the exam
it will be important to know the core assumptions that are the foundations of realist thinking. It will also be
important to be able to identify the differenc  es between classical realism and its variants, such as structural(neo)
realism, offensive realism, and defensive realism. Additionally, being able to know the distinctions and differences
between realism (in general), liberalism will also be important. Who are the key actors in realist thought? What are the
expected behaviors of these actors following realist thinking in interstate politics?

#### Foundations

Who were the key historical contributors to the development of realist thought? What ideas did they propose? What
statements would be consistent with their thought? Key thinkers and their contributions from people such as Thucydides,
Hobbes, Mearsheimer, and Waltz should be known.

#### Melian Dialog

What happens in the Melian Dialog? What factors do the Athenians and Melians think determine interstate
politics? What is the “standard of justice”? Among who does justice exist according to the Athenians?

What are the three reasons we fight according to Hobbes? What is justice according to Hobbes?

#### Tragedy of Great Power Politics

What are the causes of war according to Mearsheimer and offensive realists? What are the ideal and practical goals of

Power Theory, Logrolling, Security Dilemma. What are the implications of these concepts to interstate behavior?

## Liberalism

Liberalism has traditionally been the foil for realist thought. While the liberal tradition shares some of the
assumptions for interstate behavior with realism, it also has some very different beliefs about the choices and
opportunities that states (and other actors) face in global politics.As with realism, you will need to be able to
distinguish between classical liberal thought and its variants, such as neoliberalism.

#### Foundations

Who were the key historical contributors to the development of liberal thought? What ideas did they
propose? What statements would be consistent with their thought? Key thinkers and their contributions from people such
as Kant, Wilson, Rousseau, etc. should be known.

#### Institutions

What role do institutions, norms, and regimes play in global politics according to liberals? Be able to
identify key international institutions and the roles that they have played in international politics, such as the UN,
UN Security Council. EU, League of Nations, etc. and their membership. How did these institutions develop and evolve
over time? What do IGOs do, in terms of activities in interstate politics?

liberal power when compared to those of realist power? Are they the same?
