Free trade is perhaps the largest defining factor of the global economy. Several international organizations have been
created to regulate and assist in global trade. These organizations have not been loved by some, and have had many
criticisms levied against them and free trade as a whole.

Examining the migration of labor, the globalization of trade has changed where many jobs are. Cheap goods are produced
where it is cheap to make them, and expensive goods are made where the money is. However, this has caused problems. If
labor is cheaper in a foreign country, labor there is preferred as it is cheaper to make the good. This has moved many
industries out of domestic labor in the US, where jobs and goods are more expensive, overseas to China and other
countries [@imf]. These countries -- as realists -- make the obvious choice to improve their economic standing, and welcome the
increase in jobs this migration is bringing them.

The World Bank is one of these international organizations that has come under fire for not representing all countries
effectively. The World Bank's 'About Us' page details the goals of the organization, chief among them to reduce poverty
and increase incomes in poor countries [@aboutus]. However, the leading contributors to the Bank are those from the
Global North, e.g. the USA and EU members. This creates a bias towards these large states and supporting corporations.
The ICSID --  International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes -- is a sub-entity of the World Bank, and has
been found to prefer corporations over smaller countries [@bias]. The creation of this trans-national court was also
opposed by a number of nations from the Global South in 1964 with the "Tokyo No", protesting that this would bypass
domestic courts and legal systems of any states being sued [@bias]. This violates the principle of sovereignty of these
states, as it is now a international organization that is deciding on actions in the state when cases are brought to
this forum by e.g. an external corporation.
