Realist politics posits that states must keep all power in order to manage survival. States during the coronavirus have
implemented measures to protect themselves from other states.

As an example of these practices, many states have closed or restricted their borders for international travel. The EU
has maintained a "safe list" of countries that are allowed to visit the EU without quarantine restrictions and the like,
and last month the US was removed from the list [@peltier_2021]. Here, states are cooperating with each other to abide
by this safe list in order to further their own interests and keep their populations safe. However, some states like
Germany and Norway have further restricted travel across their own borders in January [@connolly_2021]. The US currently
imposes restrictions on all flight passengers requiring proof of a negative COVID test in the last three days
[@schwartz_murphy_2020].

Realism dictates that states cannot trust each other and must protect themselves and their
interests before all else, so closing borders to dangerous countries -- those whose travelling citizens are likely to be
infected -- to protect ones citizens from risk is rational. Leaving open borders when neighboring states have high
infection rates poses a (population) survival risk for a state. Realism has also been applied domestically, with states
like Australia imposing curfews and mandated quarantine for violators [@reuters_2021] in order to keep their own
population at a lower risk and increase the state's overall survival interest.
