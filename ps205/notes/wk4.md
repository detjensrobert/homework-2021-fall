# classical vs neo realism

classical - central focus on human nature
  human nature is bad, always has, always will
neo - just anarchy & structure of system leads to conflict

classical liberalism; human nature can change

rosseau: because we feel empathy human nature isnt *terrible*
maybe not *great* still, but not complete ass

we can cooperate over conflict
something in reality that may lead to less conflict

# liberalism:

- global politics is not a zero sum game
- not every interaction needs to be a "win"
- politics is stateful, interactions persist
- learn from interactions to improve
- interdependence
- increased trace facilitates cooperation
- economic peace treaty -- more trade, less conflict
- democratic peace treaty --

realist assumptions:
- privacy of the state
- states are unitary actor (state acts as one)

liberalists dont believe these
- states have multiple actors internally -- parties, elections, etc
- states do still matter, but not the *only* actor
- international law + democracy can be used to establish (lasting) peace
  - can weaken / attenuate natural tendency for conflict
- realists say "become the hegemon" / "always accrue power"
  - security dilemma: increace power -> now a threat -> others increase -> feedback loop
- liberalism: **less change for war by doing certain things**

# Kantian triangle: need all 3 things to have "zone of peace"

- republican constitution (state needs to be democratic)
- commercial spirit (economic interdependence)
- strong international law & institutions
  - limits anarchy by being sorta-inter-state regulation
  - treaties

if some places are missing one of the 3, zone cannot happen
all three are needed for peace to occur

## Democratic eory:

looking at states relationships with one other:
- democratic states dont fight wars with each other
- why?

russet: two explanations
- cultural
  - shared civic identity
  -
- institutional
  - different political players
  - inter-state agreements / roadblocks on war

peace between democratic states
**DOES NOT SAY** peace between democracies & non-democracies
democratic states tend to put in authoritarian regimes afterwards
