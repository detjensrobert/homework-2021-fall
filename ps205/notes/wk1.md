# Lecture 1 - 9/27

> reminder: state here means nation-state / country, not state as in USA

## Levels of analysis

three (main) kinds:
  - international (between states)
  - domestic (within a state)
  - individual (individual people)

## Theories

realism (fear, power)
  - classical
  - neo-classical
  - structural (neo-)
    - defensive
    - offensive

  - really about: *why do we fight?*, conflict, war

liberalism (economics)
  - NOT LIBERAL re: US POLITICS
  - how you view the world
  - classical
    - different view of humanity / human nature
    - humans cooperate more then we fight
  - neo-
  - neoliberal institutionalism (institutions)
    - big companies? working towards a goal

social constructivism
> not going to be tested, big and complicated
  - reality is dependent on how people interact
  - dependent on agreement between people
  - knowledge & truth is dependent upon social interactions
  - identity affecting global politics


sovereignty
  - norm: set of shared beliefs / standards
  - sovereignty: other states must respect ones claims
  - every state has absolute authority over things in their territory borders
  - both legal principle and a norm
  - not always followed though..

anarchy
  - lack of power
  - **absence of authority**
  - sub-national anarchy: lack of control over their territory

when are states recognised?
  - externally: when X% of UN agree it is a state - (yeah ok youre a state)
  - internally: some people have decided they rule over some territory - (we are now a state)
  - does being a state require external recognition?

# Lecture 2 - 9/29

anarchy (no authority) <---> (complete authority) hegemony

hegemony: absolute control over everything
hegemon: leader of a hegemony

polarity: counting # of great powers

what *are* the great powers?

what is power?
  - how much a state can influence other states into doing what they want
  - military size / power



great powers are the states that possess much more power than the average state

current great powers:
  - China
  - USA
  - ~~India~~
  - UK
  - Russia
  - ~~SA~~
  - ~~Germany~~
  - France
  - ~~Japan~~
  - ~~Brazil~~


Unipolarity - one state that dominates international structures, e.g. US circa 1992..01? post Cold War
Bipolarity - two main powers, essentially balanced, e.g. US vs USSR in Cold War (NATO vs Warsaw Pact)
Multipolarity - several main powers, usually 3-7, most of history is this
