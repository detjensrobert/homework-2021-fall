# Lecture 1 - 9/27

> reminder: state here means nation-state / country, not state as in USA

## Levels of analysis

three (main) kinds:
  - international (between states)
  - domestic (within a state)
  - individual (individual people)

## Theories

realism (fear, power)
  - classical
  - neo-classical
  - structural (neo-)
    - defensive
    - offensive

  - really about: *why do we fight?*, conflict, war

liberalism (economics)
  - NOT LIBERAL re: US POLITICS
  - how you view the world
  - classical
    - different view of humanity / human nature
    - humans cooperate more then we fight
  - neo-
  - neoliberal institutionalism (institutions)
    - big companies? working towards a goal

social constructivism
> not going to be tested, big and complicated
  - reality is dependent on how people interact
  - dependent on agreement between people
  - knowledge & truth is dependent upon social interactions
  - identity affecting global politics


sovereignty
  - norm: set of shared beliefs / standards
  - sovereignty: other states must respect ones claims
  - every state has absolute authority over things in their territory borders
  - both legal principle and a norm
  - not always followed though..

anarchy
  - lack of power
  - **absence of authority**
  - sub-national anarchy: lack of control over their territory

when are states recognised?
  - externally: when X% of UN agree it is a state - (yeah ok youre a state)
  - internally: some people have decided they rule over some territory - (we are now a state)
  - does being a state require external recognition?
