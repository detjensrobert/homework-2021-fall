midterm 11/8 open notes on Canvas

mainly multiple choice, T/F, short answer

## lecture 11/1

last week:
- rally around the flag
- domestic actors -> conflict
- national vs. particularistic interests

### gender and IR

- theory: innate differences btwn men / women
  - women are more peaceful? woman leader == less conflict?
  - evidence says no

  - maybe not inherent, but  because of how m/f are raised
  - contructivism
    - female leader in US is much different than elsewhere
    - gender norms are different everywhere
    - *context* around gender that may influence

  - define gender
    - are you a woman if you are a leader in some cultures?

  - *can* there be a statistically correct outcome?\
    - politics pretty much male dominated
    - women have to act more like a man to get in?
    - selection bias

levels of analysis (review):
- individual
  - institutional contstraints
  - public opinion constratints
- domestic
- international

### intra-state conflict

- what is terrorism?
  - using violence on civilians to incite fear and bring attention to an actor
  - one sided violence from non-state? actor for political end
  - use *or threat*
  - gain attention for political end
  - illigitimate actors

terrorists are exempt from most protections

identifying a group is also political since it strips their protections

cyberterrorism:
  - no violence -- terrorism?

coersion
provoke
spoil / prevent follow through
audience
impress to gain support

asymmetric warfare
- take out advantages that the stronger force has
- guerilla warfare / insurgency
- home stadium terrain advantage
- international factors -- proxy wars / external support

civil war solutions:
- democracy
  - participation & inclusion
  - hopefully lower tension
- economic developement
  - cw usually only happen in developing countries
- strong institutions
  - courts
  - elections
  - etc
- external peace keeping/building/enforcement
  - e.g. UN


## lecture 11/3

- definition of war
  - conflict btwn 2 parties with >= 1000 battle-related deaths within a year

criticism of international institutions
- representation
- voice
- transparency
- dist. of power of ww2 are represent by UN P5 members, but power has changed
- institutions are *not* states, so highly reliant on states to fund/enforce/etc
  - states may not want to fund IGOs if they dont agree with policy

- realists:
  - IGOs is marginal actors -- states are the primary actors
  - conflict of interest: why give up power to IGO?

two-level games
- domestic and international politics act on different levels
  - domestic politics <--> international politics can affect each other
  - internal dissonance within actor

P5 members:
- permanent 5 members of UN Security powers
- posesss absolute veto on stuff
  - US
  - UK
  - China
  - Russia
  - France

Core principles of liberalism:
- states are not the only primary actor
- human nature are not inherently evil
- intl. institutions can help ease anarchy

structural liberalism
- 5 components:
  - security co-binding
    - joining security alliances e.g. NATO / UN security council
    - collective security organizations
    - alliances: designed to defend/upset SQ
    - sec c-b: maintain the status quo
    - by joining, constraining soverignty to go against other powers
  - penetrative hegemony
    - regular hegemon: *complete* world control/domination
    - US after cold was was hegemon -- unable to be toppled
    - see US in 1999
    - hegemon would help other states out but still is greatest power
    - willing to listen to other powers
    - multiple points of access for state/non-state actors to influence hegemon
  - semi-soverignty
  - economic openness
  - civic identity
    - idea of "the west", what democracy should be

offensive neorealism:
- concerned more about relative power rather than absolute power
- dont always seek abs power, only when it improves relative stance
- security dilemma

defensive neorealism:
- relative power & imperfect information -> security spirals -> conflict
- more hesitant about increasing power
  - more power, but less secure


actual vs potential power:
- stuff that can be turned into power
  - territory
  - population
  - economic strength
  - etc

sources of:
- liberalist power
  - material power
  - institutions
  - norms
    - shared beliefs / ideas / expectations within a group
- realist power:
  - material power (measureable)
    - potential power

iteration
- repeated set of interations between any actors
- leads to more information
- interations are stateful
- no restruction on who can interact
