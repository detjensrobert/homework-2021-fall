## lecture 11/1

last week:
- rally around the flag
- domestic actors -> conflict
- national vs. particularistic interests

### gender and IR

- theory: innate differences btwn men / women
  - women are more peaceful? woman leader == less conflict?
  - evidence says no

  - maybe not inherent, but  because of how m/f are raised
  - contructivism
    - female leader in US is much different than elsewhere
    - gender norms are different everywhere
    - *context* around gender that may influence

  - define gender
    - are you a woman if you are a leader in some cultures?

  - *can* there be a statistically correct outcome?\
    - politics pretty much male dominated
    - women have to act more like a man to get in?
    - selection bias


levels of analysis (review):
- individual
  - institutional contstraints
  - public opinion constratints
- domestic
- international

### intra-state conflict

- what is terrorism?
  - using violence on civilians to incite fear and bring attention to an actor
  - one sided violence from non-state? actor for political end
  - use *or threat*
  - gain attention for political end
  - illigitimate actors

terrorists are exempt from most protections

identifying a group is also political since it strips their protections

- strong institutions
  - courts
  - elections
  - etc
- external peace keeping/building/enforcement
  - e.g. UN
