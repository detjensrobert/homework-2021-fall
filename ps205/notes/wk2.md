how do realists view politics? what type do they suggest states behave in?

Realists always look out for their own interests first. The needs of their state
come before any external states. Realist politics

- rational
  - "normal"
  - survival vs security
  - rational for NK to pursue nukes?
    - nukes as protection
    - nukes as deterrent
    - history shows having nukes -> survival

power -> survival
states that forget to keep power will cease to exist

balance of power
balance of threat
security dilemma


there is no justice in international relations
you cannot trust people to do the right thing
the only thing that can be trusted is your own power

## Hobbes

equality leads people to fight others
all humans want similar things
humans covet everything instead of equal shares
that leads to competition

the strongest person can be overcome by enough others

human nature is greedy, to covet
being nice is a farce

what are humans like when noone is looking / without any authority

- all humans want the same thing
- so we fight? why?
- no morality in the state of nature
- nothing is "wrong"
- only two things are "good" / must-have (cardial virtues)
  - power / force
  - fraud / lying
