### Chapter 7

Trade comes back the the interests, interactions, and institutions that seem to be one of the reoccurring themes of this
class. Interest conflicts lead to interactions which are dependent on institutions.

Trump made promises to keep trade internal during the 2016 election to win over Midwest states that have been greatly
affected by the migration and globalization of industry, but the President does not have the ultimate say in these sorts
of trade policies, as Congress and other institutions are also responsible for influencing trade.

Farmers in developed countries tend to be protective of their land since these states are "land-poor".

The US was very pro-trade following WWII, but into the 2000s the US has become more interested in protecting trade.

## Chapter 8

Immigration can be examined using the same metrics as international trade. Countries with an excess of labor will have
more emigration to countries that need labor.

These immigrants tend to be lower skilled, and domestic lower-skilled workers tend to push for more restrictive
immigration policies out of fear of job competition. An influx of immigrant labor (both unskilled and skilled) leads to
more competition for the available jobs, lowering the wages for those jobs.
