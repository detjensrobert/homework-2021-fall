## Realism

### Realist World

I notice this piece draws attention to the bank bailouts of 2008 / the Great Recession, but there were not individual bailouts. I remember hearing about those bailouts and wondering what the long term consequences of being "too big to fail" but needing bailouts would be.

Theres an interesting dichotomy on how globalization and investing abroad creates an overall increase in economic gain and reduction in poverty, but internally creates feelings of "betrayal".

"Only a few Cassandras [...]" -- what or who are Cassandras? I gather from surrounding context that this label is applied to people who are forward thinkers a/o who think outside of the status quo, but what is the origin of this term?

This piece looks to get at how the US has dominated the global scene for the last few decades, but now that China has grown to be at or above the power of the US, how can the US retreat from being the head of the global economy without making it look like a failure?

### Thucydides' Melian Dialogue

Athens wil not accept Melos being an ally instead of subservient to the empire, because having an equal would be a sign of weakness. Athens posits that the conflict is not a fair fight and Melos does not have the power to stop Athens. This seems much like Attila showing up at a city and demanding surrender lest it be razed as we discussed in class last week. Melos wants to wait for Sparta to come and save them, but Athens makes clear than it is not on Sparta's interests to protect them. Help never came from Sparta, and Melos was sacked.

Melos made erroneous assumptions about Sparta's interests and cost them their lives.

### Leviathan, excerpt

Hobbes's writing looks to fall under realism, where everyone protects their property or interests from other people because of the innate desires of others and the conflict from them. Laws mean nothing unless there is a central power to make and enforce them.

### The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, ch. 2

States should inherently fear each other since they can always be wiped out by other powers. There is no meta-government to turn to for outside conflict resolution, so paranoia is justified. States need to look out for themselves to ensure their survival. Be the most powerful state so others will be scared to attack.

Water is the main blocker for creating a total hegemony; the US controls the entire Western Hemisphere, but although there is a land bridge between North and South America, the distance needed would make going over water much faster or more convenient. How is the US able to control both Americas over such a great distance?
