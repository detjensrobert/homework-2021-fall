## Chapter 6

Non-state actors like terrorist groups do not have access to the institutions that states do, reducing the opportunities
for negotiation or remediation from those third party institutions and leading to a higher likelihood of conflict.
Civil war and terrorism are not the same and should never be confused: Terrorists target civilians (for political gain)
in order to create fear; civil war is an intra-state conflict. However, they do share *some* similarities: conflict
coming from a desire for political power. The means to an end are quite different.

Civil wars can cause neighboring states to also become unstable, so e.g. the UN has some interest in controlling civil
wars to prevent one state from collapsing a whole bunch.

Rebellion is usually because of greed and/or grievances. Separatists want to separate fully and become an independent
state; irredentists want to change allegiances to a different state.

Splitting a state into two based on nations may solve an immediate problem, but how far down do you go? e.g. South Sudan
seceded from Sudan because of ethnic differences, but then had another civil war internally a couple years later.
Perhaps use institutions to protect minorities rather than splitting them off?

Civil wars can be exacerbated by internal country-level problems, e.g. if there is no way for the population to address
grievances through normal political channels. Internal groups can have a very strong identity together and have close
ties, helping them work together in rebellion. External actors can also fight by proxy, supporting opposite sides in the
conflict (e.g. Vietnam War, US vs. USSR).

Once the rebel group has amassed power, they now have negotiation power because of the threat of civil war. There may
not be any actual war if both actors are able to settle (as with inter-state war). However, the problems that cause
civil war and unrest are usually more deeply rooted and not easily solved, or an immediate war may be preferrable since
the rebels' power may not be as secure as the government's.

Terrorism may seem logically irrational, but is politically rational.
