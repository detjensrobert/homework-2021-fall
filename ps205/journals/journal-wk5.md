## Chapter 4

Unlike realism, which posits that states are unitary and only react to external powers, states can have internal
politics that affect what they do. Things like ensuring domestically-critical resources from foreign sources can be a
driver for conflict.

Domestic institutions affect who is in power either through elections & marketing, or through monarcharial succession

Leaders / governments can also go to war to further support for themselves by improving public opinion, or due to
personal ideals -- see the rally effect.

People tend to rally around national identity when confronted with an outside conflict, which may help prevent internal
conflicts or distract from other internal troubles, e.g. a revolution or economic instability by redirecting hostilities
elsewhere instead of to each other.

Leaders may also enter war with the explicit purpose to use the rally effect -- the diversionary incentive. This may
cause the state to possibly overextend on resources and not accept less favorable compromise. The benefits from a rally
may also move the bargaining range mire in favor of the state than without the rally.

If the war is unsuccessful, e.g. Russ-Japanese War, domestic unrest may increase.

War is a gamble, and not to be undertaken lightly.

Sometimes the military complex may be more willing to go to war than the rest of the country -- the population or the
other govt. branches (Pakistan vs. India), or the converse -- the military may be more cautious but oushed into war by
the people or government (US in Iraq war).

Private commercial entities may convince their govt to go (or not to go) to war to protect their investments when the
govt. may have the opposite leaning.

Domestic actors cannot directly cause a state to go to war, but can affect how far the state is willing to go.
